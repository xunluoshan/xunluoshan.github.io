# General issues

——about methods of studying symptoms and signs

## Psychopathology
`the study of abnormal states of mind`
here are two approaches to the subject:
### descriptive psychopathology
- <u>definition:</u> 
> objective description of abnormal states of mind, 
> especially  **conscious experiences** & **observable behavior**.
- sometimes called *phenomenology* (slightly different), more than *symptomatology*.
- <u>Aim:</u> 
> 1. elucidate the essential qualities of morbid mental experiences
> 2. understand each patients' experience of illness
- <u>Exponent:</u> 
> *Karl Jaspers*
> *General psychopathology* , first published in 1913, still the most complete account of the subject.

### experimental psychopathology
`explain & describe abnormal mental phenomena`
1. <u>psychodynamic psychopathology</u> -- originate in Freud's psychoanalysis
>   causes are unconscious mental processes
>   , including mechanisms of repression and projection
2. <u>cognitive and behavioral psychology</u> 
- empirically measurable and verifiable conscious psychological processes
- using functional brain imaging (FRI)


## Terms and concepts
### symptoms and signs
- In psychiatry, there are only few signs, such as [[catatonic schizophrenia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]]. Most diagnostic information comes from the history and observation. 
- **sign** refers to:
1. feature noted by observer
2. a group of symptoms as a sign of particular disorder
- Here, 'symptoms and signs' ≈ symptoms = phenomena of psychiatric disorders
### subjective and objective
- **Objective:** features observed during the interview.
-    often used to compare this with the patient's description of symptoms.
> low mood, tearfulness      ---subjective
> poor eye contact, psychomotor retardation, crying      ---objective

|              | objective √     |          objective ×           |
| ------------ | :-------------: | :----------------------------: |
| subjective √ | strong evidence | not diagnose, need to question |
| subjective × | may diagnose    |               --               |

```
As a rule, objective signs are accorded greater weight.
```
### form and content
- form: e.g. auditory [[hallucination]]; repeated intrusive thoughts 
- content: e.g. the statement that he is homosexual.
> Form is often critical when making diagnosis.
> Content is less diagnostically useful, but can be important in management.
- <u>Caution:</u> patients concern content more than form! (may be irritated)
### primary and secondary (symptoms or syndromes)
- two different meanings:
1. temporal: which occurs first.
2. casual: primary means arising directly from the pathological process;
        secondary means as a reaction to a primary symptom.
### understanding and explanation
1. Understanding: attempt to appreciate the patient's subjective experience.
> need: intuition & empathy
2. Explanation: account for events in terms of external factors.
> need: knowledge of psychiatric aetiology

`体验派 vs. 表现派`
`感性 vs. 理性
`emotional & cognitive empathy`
`person-centred therapy vs. cbt`
### Significance of individual symptoms
- Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed when a defined group of symptoms (a syndrome) is present.
- But almost any single symptom can be experienced by a healthy person.
> include hallucinations, but a delusion, if it is unequivocal and persistent, can be evidence of psychiatric disorder.

- **In general**, a single symptom is not evidence of psychiatric disorder, but an indication for a thorough and repeated search for other symptoms of disorder.
- <u>Danger of not adhering,</u> the study by Rosenhan(1973), 8 'patients' with just complaint of hearing words, denying other symptoms and behave normally, and eventually get diagnosis of schizophrenia.
### patients' experience



### cultural variation in psychopathology
