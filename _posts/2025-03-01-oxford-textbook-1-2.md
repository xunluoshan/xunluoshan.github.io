# General issues

——about methods of studying symptoms and signs

## Psychopathology
`the study of abnormal states of mind`  

Here are two approaches to the subject:
{:.info}

### descriptive psychopathology
- <u>definition:</u>  
🐶 objective description of abnormal states of mind,   
🐶 especially  **conscious experiences** & **observable behavior**.
- Sometimes called *phenomenology* (slightly different), more than *symptomatology*.
- <u>Aim:</u>   
1. elucidate the essential qualities of morbid mental experiences  
2. understand each patients' experience of illness
- <u>Exponent:</u>   
🐶 ***Karl Jaspers***  
🐶 *General psychopathology* , first published in 1913, still the most complete account of the subject.

### experimental psychopathology
`explain & describe abnormal mental phenomena`
1. <u>psychodynamic psychopathology</u> -- originate in Freud's psychoanalysis  
🐶 causes are unconscious mental processes,
🐶 including mechanisms of repression and projection
3. <u>cognitive and behavioral psychology</u> 
- empirically measurable and verifiable conscious psychological processes
- using functional brain imaging (FRI)


## Terms and Concepts
### symptoms and signs
- In psychiatry, there are only few signs, such as [catatonic schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563222/) or [anorexia nervosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa). Most diagnostic information comes from the history and observation. 
- **sign** refers to:
1. feature noted by observer
2. a group of symptoms as a sign of particular disorder
- Here, 'symptoms and signs' ≈ symptoms = phenomena of psychiatric disorders

### subjective and objective
- **Objective:** features observed during the interview.
-    often used to compare this with the patient's description of symptoms.

  low mood, tearfulness      ---subjective  
  poor eye contact, psychomotor retardation, crying      ---objective
{:.success}

|              | objective √     |          objective ×           |
| ------------ | :-------------: | :----------------------------: |
| subjective √ | strong evidence | not diagnose, need to question |
| subjective × | may diagnose    |               --               |

```

  "As a rule, objective signs are accorded greater weight."

```
### form and content
- **form**: e.g. auditory [hallucination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination); repeated intrusive thoughts 
- **content**: e.g. the statement that he is homosexual.

🐶   Form is often critical when making diagnosis.  
🐶   Content is less diagnostically useful, but can be important in management.

⚠️ **Caution**:  
patients concern content more than form! (may be irritated)
{:.warning}

### primary and secondary (symptoms or syndromes)
**Two different meanings**:  
1. temporal: which occurs first.
2. casual: primary means arising directly from the pathological process;
        secondary means as a reaction to a primary symptom.

### understanding and explanation
1. **Understanding**: attempt to appreciate the patient's subjective experience.
- 🔧Need: intuition & empathy

2. **Explanation**: account for events in terms of external factors.
- 🔧Need: knowledge of psychiatric aetiology

`体验派 vs. 表现派`  
`感性 vs. 理性`  
`emotional & cognitive empathy`  
`person-centred therapy vs. cbt`

### significance of individual symptoms
- Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed when a defined group of symptoms (a syndrome) is present.
- But almost any single symptom can be experienced by a healthy person.
> include hallucinations, but a delusion, if it is unequivocal and persistent, can be evidence of psychiatric disorder.

- **In general**, a single symptom is not evidence of psychiatric disorder, but an indication for a thorough and repeated search for other symptoms of disorder.
- <u>Danger of not adhering,</u> the study by Rosenhan(1973), 8 'patients' with just complaint of hearing words, denying other symptoms and behave normally, and eventually get diagnosis of schizophrenia.
  
### patients' experience



### cultural variation in psychopathology
